# OPENSTACK VM MIGRATOR
This is a tool for migrating VMs in Openstack to the hypervisor of your choice.
The idea behind this tool was to allow specific migrations that are decided by the 
Openstack Nova scheduler. This tool can display the current usuage stats per hypervisor
after you select on the VM to move from the hypervisor in question.
